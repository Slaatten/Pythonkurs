Run python code with ctrl + r. Make your own shortcuts at "Open Keyboard Shortcuts" Command pallette. Or write in the terminal "python3 main.py"

There are many Functions you can call upon in Python. len() is an example. This gives the length of a string. What you put in the parantes is called arguments. 
Index -1 is the last characther of the variabel. We use the [0:3] to get spesific or a part of a String. 

Backslash "escapes" the charachter after the \. \n moves it to the other line.

To format strings in Python is very important. full_name = f"{first}, {last}".

Methods is what comes up after a dot. If you got a variable "course". If you write course. you will get alot of different options. This is called methods. 

We have integers, floats and complex numbers. // is division with no decimals. 10 ** 3 = 1000. 

A modul contains alot of additonally methods and functions. You import it with the syntax "import" at the top and the name. f.eks import math

Type conversion with for example int(x).
